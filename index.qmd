## About Me

I am a graduate student in **Biomedical Engineering** at Case Western Reserve University, with dual bachelor's degrees in Biomedical Engineering and Computer Science. Currently, I am conducting research at the **Cardiovascular Innovation Research Center (CIRC)** at Cleveland Clinic Foundation, where I collaborate with Siemens technical specialists on advanced cardiac MRI data processing and analysis.

My research focuses on developing **next-generation cardiac diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) techniques** and integrating machine learning approaches into cardiovascular imaging applications. I am passionate about leveraging computational methods to solve complex biomedical challenges, particularly in medical imaging and cardiac health.

With strong expertise in **Python and Java programming**, I combine my engineering background with clinical applications to advance the field of cardiac imaging. I am dedicated to translating novel technologies into practical clinical solutions that can improve patient care.
