## Teaching Philosophy

I believe in creating an inclusive and engaging learning environment where students feel empowered to explore complex concepts through hands-on experience and collaborative problem-solving. My teaching approach emphasizes practical applications, clear communication, and individualized support to help each student reach their full potential.
